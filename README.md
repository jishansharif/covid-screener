# Inspiration
Companies are mandated by the government in Canada to ensure that their employees can fulfill a checklist of questions as well as a temperature-check on the daily.
This process is extremely inefficient and causes there to be an unnecessary high level of contact between employees and managers and can easily be optimized and made safer.

# How does it work
Our device will plan to create space and atomize this process to make it as safe and quick as possible while also meeting legislated guidelines.

# How we built it
Our solution is essentially an employee-scanning self device that will automate this entire process for companies and small businesses alike. 
An automated device that consists of a temperature sensor module, a touchscreen monitor as well as a mini-computer to bridge it together (Raspberry Pi 4).

# Accomplishments

The device was brought to a Walmart store where we got feedback from the store manager. An important thing to consider is the device is relatively cheap and provides efficient work and is extremely reliable. Our product is very user friendly and intuitive. 
This strengthens our belief that we can really help small businesses, health departments during these unprecedented times.

# Built with
MySQL, Rasberry Pi, Python
